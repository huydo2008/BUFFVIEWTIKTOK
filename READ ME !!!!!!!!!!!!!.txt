this is a simple tool to use, you need python installed or it will close.

instructions:
install chromedriver here : https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
place it in the folder
open command console inside of Tiktok folder
install the requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt) inside command prompt
now run the tool and choose your option.

NOTICE**
this tool is almost fully automated, all you have to do is enter the captcha at the start and 
then leave it running for as long as you want, do not mess with the chrome tab after you enter 
the captcha or you might break the sequence of the tool.

____________________________________________________________

a few common issues with python selenium is the use of a wrong chromedriver version so make sure you have the right one installed
if you cannot install requirements then your cmd console isn't opened in the folder.
use (cd Desktop) - (cd Tiktok) if your folder is on your desktop.
now try again https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
